<h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Where are you based?</p>
        <p>I am currently living in Virginia.</p>
            
            <p>How do you spend your free time?</p>
            <p>I love spending time outdoors with friends and family - hiking, biking, and exploring different parks for the scenery and wildlife experiences.  When at home, I enjoy caring for my indoor plants and gardens, playing games, and just hanging out with my friends.</p>
            
            <p>What’s a fun fact about you?</p>
            <p>I used to help with wildlife rehabilitation and also volunteered at the zoo. Learning how to care for all the different species was amazing. The best part was getting to pet rhinos and getting to see their different personalities. </p>   
            
            <p>What’s your professional experience?</p>
            <p>I earned my Bachelor of Science degree (Cum Laude) in Graphic Design at LaRoche University outside of Pittsburgh, PA. Surprisingly one of the classes I enjoyed the most was psychology--recognizing how design affects human thoughts and feelings amazed me.</p> 
            <p>After college, I started as an intern with the Society of Automotive Engineers and within seven years worked my way up to be Team Lead of the Aerospace group with three direct reports. I managed all the projects that came through for our team. One of the projects was quarterly Aerospace Engineering magazine. When my husband needed to move for his job, they put me under contract to remotely manage and produce the magazine while working with the editor.</p>             
            <p>Once in Virginia, this gave me a opportunity to start my own business and Wolfe Design Studio was established. The business was built through networking and referrals. I've had many clients for over 10 years each. As a freelancer, I got to work on numerous types of design projects. I helped companies establish and grow their branding with marketing communication pieces and website design. I've also had the privilege to work with many marketing consultants, writers, and web developers to offer complete agency packages. The favorite part of what I do is having the opportunity to work with a variety of industries and businesses, but mostly getting to help a diverse group of owners grow their businesses to the next level.</p>            
            <p>I've coordinated multiple projects between multiple clients and industries. In addition to collaborating with clients, client teams, sub-contractors, and vendors, as well as designing, I've always managed to meet tight deadlines. Because of this, I feel product management would be a natural fit and next step.</p>
            
            <p>Why do you think having UX and frontend development skills is valuable for product management?</p>
            <p>Knowing the end-to-end process is essential. Getting to work with the stake holders and hearing the strategy and limitations behind the project sets the foundation for the next step. Understanding the end user and researching what works best for them helps in designing experiences that they enjoy. Knowing how to test features and establish visual consistency also creates an end product that the user is happy with. Understanding how to communicate with product developers is key to help it all come together.</p>
