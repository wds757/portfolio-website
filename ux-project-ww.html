              <h1>Weatherly Waterways Responsive Web App</h1>
              <p>Plan a fun day on the water with ease. View the weather data that matters to you and find new places to launch.  No matter your water sport, the waterway maps make sharing with friends easy and safe!</p>

<!--intro-->
              <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Are you struggling to find an easy-to-comprehend weather app that focuses on weather that is important to you and your preferred water sport?</p>
 
              <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>Reviewed project brief, business requirements, design criteria, and hypothesized user stories and job stories
                  Researched user needs including a competitive analysis, in-person interviews, and surveys
                  Created user flows for 3 core features and established 3 personas
                  Used the iterative process by testing features, card sorting, remote user testing, preference testing, team feedback, established design guidelines and updated prototypes based on the feedback received 
                  Once it was presented and approved, assets were gathered for hand off to the developers, with consideration to future iterations and lessons learned</p>

              <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>Create a simple weather app that provides water sport enthusiasts an easy way to plan their day on the water.</p>

              <h2>Case-Study Overview</h2>
                <p>This was a class project that represented the UX design process end-to-end within the context of a mobile app-building project.<br>

                  <!--insert logo graphic here - based on viewport-->

<!--section 1-->
              <h1>1. Initial Hypothesis</h1>
                <p>PROBLEM: Most weather apps have a lot of extra information that the typical user doesn’t need. The apps don’t focus on what is important to the user for their particular water sport or how the weather affects the waterways.<br>
                  HYPOTHESIS: We believe that by seeing a clean simple dashboard that focuses on the weather that is important to the user, it will capture the user’s interest.<br>
                  INITIAL PROBLEM STATEMENT: Visiting water sport enthusiasts need a way to easily comprehend the local weather and how it affects various local waterways because they are only here for a short time and want feedback and referrals from the locals. We will know this to be true when we see engagement on the app.</p>
              
              <h2>User Stories</h2>
                  <p>(1 EXAMPLE FROM 10 CREATED)<br><br>

                    FEATURE: Location & Ability To Share<br>
                    As an excursion planner, I want to see the location and temperatures immediately so that I can plan my water activities and share them with my group.</p>

<!--section 2-->
              <h1>2. Research & Results</h1>
                <p>After creating the User Stories & Job Stories, a Competitive Analysis of 3 weather apps (1Weather, Tide Guide, & WeatherBug) was done to gather information needed to create the interview questions.</p>

              <h2>In-person Interviews</h2>
                <p>(16 QUESTIONS; 3 PARTICIPANTS)<br><br>

                  GOALS:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Documenting user opinions on competing sites or apps that inform the design of the project</li>
                    <li>Determining which apps or sites your users enjoy using, as well as what types of apps or sites leave them frustrated</li>
                    <li>Discerning the types of tasks users perform and in what contexts</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  SUMMARY:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>All three seemed to want something that was clean and simple to use with little to no navigation</li>
                    <li>They were very unhappy with ads but didn’t want to pay for a weather app</li>
                    <li>Inaccurate reports were also a point of friction</li>
                    <li>The UV index and air quality weren’t much of a concern for anyone</li>
                  </ul>

                <!--insert quote box here - based on viewport?-->
                <p>Give me a one-stop shop. - User Participant</p>

                <p>!!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: Most weather apps contain ads and it was the number one complaint. I should have reworded one of the questions to “Besides ads, what would be the biggest friction point?” Then I would have received more data on the friction points.</p>



<!--section 3-->
              <h1>3 User Flows & Personas</h1>
                <p>From the research above, I analyzed the information using Affinity Mapping and an Empathy Map Canvas. From those emerging themes, I gathered features and pain points that were important to the users’ experiences.</p>

              <h2>Personas</h2>
                <p>From the above insights, 3 personas were created:<br><br>

                <ul>
                  <li>Notifications of dangers in the water like sharks and snakes</li>
                  <li>Waterway maps would be nice so we don’t get lost</li>
                  <li>Would like a way to share experiences with friends on social media</li>
                  <li>Needs to know the tides so she doesn’t get stuck and not be able to get back in</li>

                TODD THE TRENDY TOURIST - GOALS & NEEDS:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Likes to hear from the locals</li>
                  <li>He likes to choose the range of temperatures that he considers ideal</li>
                  <li>He would like to know when high and low tides are for the best times to search for shells</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I love the outdoors and speading time on the water, but not necessarily in it. - Christine the Chillin' Chick</p>

                <p>!!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: Although this was my favorite part of the process, it did present a challenge when trying to come up with the right questions for the interviews. Having limited experience with what the process would entail after the interview, I wasn’t sure what I would be doing with the information gathered. The saying “trust the process” was quite accurate in this case as I realized all the necessary information to create the personas was in the feedback.</p>


<!--section 4-->
                <h1>4. Iterative Process</h1>
                <p>After the Task Analysis & User Flows for each persona were established, a mobile-first design was approached. I created the main navigation for the mobile app and desktop. Card Sorting helped to validate or update my choices.</p>


                <h2>Card Sorting</h2>
                <p>(20 CARDS; 7 PARTICIPANTS; OPTIMAL WORKSHOP)<br><br>

                GOAL:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>The initial Site Map was set up and refined with Card Sorting (open sort)</li>
                </ul>
                SUMMARY:<br>
                The Similarity Matrix validated what to update in my Site Map:
                <ul>
                  <li>Changed “Rentals” to “Things to Do”</li>
                  <li>Changed “Air Temps” to “Weather”</li>
                  <li>Added “Account” to “Settings”</li>
                  <li>Added “Share Location”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>!!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: Doing an open sort was confusing to most of the participants on how to do it. I should have used a close sort. And they were having issues viewing all the cards on their devices. I relied on the Similarity Matrix (85s & 100s) for the new data.</p>
                <!--insert Matrix graphic here - based on viewport-->

                <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                <p>(3 TASK FLOWS; 7 PARTICIPANTS)<br><br>
                  With Neilsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics and Rapid Prototyping in mind, low and mid-fidelity prototypes were established and now it was time for testing! I set up a recruitment plan and script. Seven participants preformed three task flows via Zoom with Figma wireframes.</p>
                  
                GOALS:<br>
                To validate the ease of use for the 3 core features:<br>
                1. Custom Home Screen, 2. Safety, and 3. Things To Do<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Can the user navigate the “things to do” section?</li>
                  <li>Can the user find “safety” information easily?</li>
                  <li>Create a custom home screen through “settings”</li>
                  <li>Gather metrics for Errors and Satisfaction</li>
                </ul>

                <p>SUMMARY:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>After organizing an Affinity Map I transferred the patterns to the Rainbow Spread Sheet.</li>
                  <li>With these 3 items in mind: Goals from Test Plan, Main Features/Functions Needed, and Business Needs, I focused on solutions for major errors as well as future iterations.

                <p>Share! I like that I can share with my friends! - Participant 6</p>


              <h2>Preference Test</h2>
              <p>(2 HOME SCREENS; 15 PARTICIPANTS; USABILITYHUB)<br><br>

              GOALS:<br>
              <p>Since the weather card customization was a main feature of the app, I wanted to see which card layout/design the users preferred.</p>
                
              SUMMARY:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Test results were “not statistically significant”--v1 won by one vote</li>
                <li>HOWEVER, 4 out of 5 in the U.S. chose v2</li>
                <li>This app is targeting the Virginia area, so for that reason, I agreed with v2</li>
                <li>And my original design reasoning also aligned with more people that voted on v2</li>
              </ul>

              <!--insert quote box here - based on viewport?-->
              <p>The information hierarchy in the [v2] cards is way better. I see immediately the data that is most important. - User Participant</p>

              <p>!!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: I was concerned when I saw the results were “not statistically significant”. I wasn’t sure if I should test again or not. But after further review of the data, I found the differences between the U.S. choices compared to the other countries which helped validate the results.</p>

            <h2>Design Language System</h2>

            GOALS:<br>
            To create design guidelines for future teams to make changes without loosing the branded look of the interface.

            SUMMARY:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Colors from the ocean were used throughout</li>
              <li>Roboto Flex font was used for it’s simplicity</li>
              <li>UI and icons were chosen for their simplicity as well</li>
              <li>Imagery was chosen to express fun and excitement</li>
              <li>Accessibility plugins were run to check for color contrast and text size issues</li>
              <li>Further iterations were made to the prototypes to make everything more consistent once the design guides were established</li>
              <li>We also reviewed basic design principles and Material Design Components to further polish the design</li>
            </ul>
            <!--insert Guidelines graphic here - based on viewport-->

            </picture>

            <p>!!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: When reviewing the Layout Anatomy from the Material Design Guidelines under the recommended grid behavior for device breakpoints, there seemed to be inconsistent information so I wasn’t clear on which to choose. Accessibility tests and grids were introduced toward the end and I feel it would have been more efficient to use these at the beginning of the process.</p>


<!--section 5-->
           <h1>5. Handoff</h1>

            ORIGINAL GOAL:<br>
            <p>To create a simple weather app that provides water sport enthusiasts an easy way to plan their day on the water.</p>
            
            SUMMARY:<br>
            <p>My solution was a simple source of weather information that helps user decide when and where is the best time to enjoy their water activities.</p>

<!--insert quote box here - based on viewport?-->
<p>Very clean and easy to follow. - Test Participant</p>

<!--insert Demo Video here -->  


FUTURE ITERATIONS:<br>
<ul>
  <li>I would like to add a comments section for users to add area information and photos.</li>
  <li>From the home screen, the other main buttons is “View Waterways”. Due to time constraints, this task flow did not get attention but it would add value for the user to see the maps and plan a route.
  </li>
</ul>

LESSONS LEARNED:<br>
<ul>
  <li>I enjoyed the research part of the process the most! I loved the Affinity Mapping and seeing what emerged with the first sort and then sorting it differently to create a different viewpoint and outcome.
  </li>
  <li>I really did empathize with the users and their pain points while keeping in mind I was not the user.
  </li>
  <li>I’ve realized that how I ask the question has a direct impact on what data will be created.
  </li>
  <li>Various feedback from the users added more value to the iterations of the prototypes thus creating a better product—yet still, plenty of room for improvement! I’ve realized products are never complete.
  </li>
</ul>
